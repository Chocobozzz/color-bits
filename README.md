Fast & efficient color manipulation library, for high-performance critical applications. This library represents RGBA colors as a single `int32` number and avoids allocating memory as much as possible while parsing, handling, and formatting colors.

Due to the compact representation, `color-bits` preserves at most 8 bits of precision for each channel, so an operation like `alpha(color, 0.000001)` would simply return the same color with no modification.

`color-bits` supports the full CSS Color Module Level 4 color spaces *in absolute representations only*, so `oklab(59.69% 0.1007 0.1191)` yes, `oklab(from green l a b / 0.5)` no. When parsing and converting non-sRGB color spaces, `color-bits` behaves the same as browsers behave, which differs from the formal CSS spec! (In technical terms: non-sRGB color spaces with a wide gamut are converted using clipping rather than gamut-mapping).
